	<h1>About Dan Santos</h1>
	<img border="2px" src="NickAndI.jpg">

	<p>I was born on July 15, 1974 in St. Vincent's Hospital in Greenwich Village, NYC. I was raised in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, first living on 15th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues, then moving up to 28th Street between 8th and 9th Avenues.</p>

	<p>I attended St. Bernard's Elementery School in the Village, before moving on to Xavier High School on 16th Street, from where I graduated in 1992. I then decided to attend Syracuse University, where I majored in Advertising Design in Syracuse's College of Visual and Performing Arts, before graduating in 1996.</p>

	<p>After graduating I decided to stay upstae and worked as a graphic designer before deciding to move back home and work for a global B2B advertising agency named <a href="http://steinias.com/">Stein IAS</a>, where I am now Director of Creative Services.</p>

	<p>Our clients include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://business.westernunion.com/">Wester Union Business Solutions</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.1010data.com/">1010 Data</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.merck-animal-health-usa.com/">Merck Animal Health</a></li>
			<li><a href="http://www.steinias.com/work/">Many more boring B2B clients ;)</a></li>
		</ul>
	
	<p>My most proud moment is when my son, Nicolas, was born on March 7, 2007 at 12:28pm, measuring 20.5" and weighing 8lbs, 7 oz. Every year we go to <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/">Disney World</a> for his birthday, one of mine and his favorite vacation spots.</p>

	<p>I am currently engaged to Kristen Rumfola, and we plan on marrying in the Spring or Fall of next year, hopefully on a beach somewhere in the Carribean.</p>
